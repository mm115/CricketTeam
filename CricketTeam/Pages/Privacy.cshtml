    The India men's national cricket team, also known as Team
    India[8] and Men in Blue,[9] is governed by the Board
    of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and is a Full Member of the
    International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test , One-Day International (ODI)
    and Twenty20 International (T20I) status.

    Cricket was introduced to India
    by British sailors in the 18th century,
    and the first cricket club was established in 1792.
    India's national cricket team did
    not play its first Test match until 25 June 1932 at Lord's,
    becoming the sixth team to be granted test cricket status.
    From 1932 India had to wait until 1952,
    almost 20 years for its first Test victory.
    In its first fifty years of international
    cricket, India was one of the weaker teams,
    winning only 35 of the first 196 Test matches it played.
    The team, however, gained strength in the 1970s
    with the emergence of players such as batsmen Gavaskar,
    Viswanath, Kapil Dev, and the Indian spin quartet..
